        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
            <li>1 loaf crusty French bread, cut into bite-sized pieces</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 pinch ground cinnamon, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar, or as needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cooking Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Grease a 9x12-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Stir 1 cup brown sugar and butter together in a saucepan over 
                medium-low heat until butter melts and sugar dissolves into butter, 
                2 to 4 minutes. Pour into prepared baking dish and spread a 1 1/2- 
                to 2-inch layer of bread pieces over the top.</li>
            <li>Beat milk, eggs, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; pour milk mixture 
                over bread into the baking dish and move bread as necessary to ensure all 
                bread is absorbing liquid. Sprinkle cinnamon over the top. Cover the dish 
                with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Remove and discard plastic 
                wrap from baking dish and sprinkle remaining brown sugar over the top of the 
                bread mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
