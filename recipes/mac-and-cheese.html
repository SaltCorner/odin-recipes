        <h3>Cooking Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Spray a 9x13-inch casserole dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a boil.
                 Stir in the macaroni and return to a boil. 
                 Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until it has cooked
                  through but is still slightly firm, about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Slowly melt butter in a large pot over low heat.
                Stir in evaporated milk and black pepper;
                cook until heated through.</li>
            <li>Whisk eggs in a bowl until smooth;
                 whisk about 1/2 cup of the evaporated milk mixture into the eggs,
                  1 tablespoon at a time, until thoroughly incorporated.
                   Whisk the egg mixture back into the saucepan with evaporated milk
                    mixture. Continue to heat gently, whisking constantly,
                     until the evaporated milk mixture almost comes to a simmer
                      and the sauce thickens.</li>
            <li>Gently mix salt and cooked macaroni into the sauce and 
                stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Spoon 1/4 of the macaroni mixture in a layer into the bottom of the
                 prepared casserole dish and top with 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese.
                  Repeat layers three more times; top last cheese layer with paprika
                   to taste.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling, 
                about 20 minutes.</li>
